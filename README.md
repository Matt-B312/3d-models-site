## General Overview

3D Models Site is a 3D model sharing platform that allows creators to easily showcase and share their 3d models with the rest of the users on the site.
For now we are focusing on GLB files but also plan to have a 3d printing (STL) section.

## Account

Before being able to download, like or favorite any of the models you must first make an account and then log in. You can navigate using the main Navigation Bar at the top and can also log out from there.

## Logged in Page

The home page when logged in will be a list of your favorite models.

## Post List Page

The Post list page will display all of the models on the site with limited infinscroll functionality to minimize .

## Post Detail Page

Each post will have a detail page that allows the post creator to upload more images/edit post and allows users to download the files and comment/favorite/like.

## Getting Started

## About The Project

For our third project at software engineering bootcamp we are making a 3D model sharing platform.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate and practice our newly learned skills from unit 3: Django, Python, and postgreSQL.

3D Models Site was built in one week.
